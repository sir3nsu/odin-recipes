    <p>French Toast stuffed with raspberries and cream cheese.</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cinnamon</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup raspberry puree</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 loaf French bread, cut into 1 inch slices</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
        <li>nutmeg, for topping</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk milk, vanilla, sugar, and cinnamon into the beaten eggs until well blended. Set aside. In a separate bowl, cream together raspberry puree and cream cheese until smooth. Make 'sandwiches' by cutting each slice of bread in half and spreading raspberry-cheese mixture in the center, then top with the other half.
        </li>
        <li>Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet or griddle. Dip bread into egg mixture, coating thoroughly. Cook until well-browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar and nutmeg. Serve immediately.</li>
